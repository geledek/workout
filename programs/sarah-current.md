# Sarah's Rehab Program

**Last Updated:** 8 Jan 2025
**Phase:** Rehab to Performance Transition

## DAILY Exercises

- **Breathing and body awareness** in supine to crook and back, sitting and standing. Daily.
- **Hip airplanes** x 12-15 every morning
- **Seated pelvic tilts with band** - to learn eccentric anterior core control
- **TFL releases**
- **Glute bridges** x 10-15 - for hip extension, not lumbar extension

## 2x/week Program

- **Supported cossacks** x 20
- **Hip airplanes** x 15 per side
- **McGill big 3**
- **Quadruped hip CARs** x 2-3 sets x 5 each direction, each side
- **Elbow planks** 3 x 45-60s (don't feel lower back pain or dumping into lower back)

### 3 rounds:
- **Seated lumbar lateral flexion** 4kg DB, x 8-10 - for downregulating QL, so it should not feel like you are working hard. It's more about control.
- **Hamstring bridge iso hold** x 30s, single leg x 15s
- **Single leg RDLs** with 7kg DBs, x 8-10
- **Hip airplanes** with 8kg KB with stiffer knee (don't bend as much), x 8-10
- **Side plank** on elbow and knee, with top knee extended. x 8

## 1x/week Program

- **Single leg squats** 3 x 15
- **Single leg hop NCM** with orange band 3 x 10
- **Single leg hop NCM front and back** with orange band 3 x 8
- **Supported single leg hop onto stepper** 5 x 6 rest 1 min between. Focus on equal hips landing (no twisting, no hiking of hip)
- **Banded lunges pushing up** 2 x 12
- **Bulgarian squats** with front heel elevated 3 x 6-8

## Notes

- Focus on control and form over intensity
- Avoid lumbar extension during all hip extension work
- Single leg work is crucial for hip stability and preventing compensation patterns

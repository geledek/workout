## Plyometrics Note

Get a good balance of ground contact time and height — don't sacrifice height for ground contact time.

- **Frequency:** Don't increase running frequency

## Notes

- Focus on control and form over intensity
- Avoid lumbar extension during all hip extension work
- Single leg work is crucial for hip stability and preventing compensation patterns

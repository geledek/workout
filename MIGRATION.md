## Migration Notice (2026-02-20)

Active workout management has moved to the OpenClaw workspace at `geledek/openclaw-memory` under `/fitness/`.

### What's here (archive)
- Weekly records: W04 through W08 (and any future completed weeks pushed here)
- Historical programs, research, and exercise notes
- iOS app design docs

### What moved
- `profile.md` → `openclaw-memory/fitness/profile.md`
- `programs/` → `openclaw-memory/fitness/programs/`
- `metrics.md` → `openclaw-memory/fitness/metrics.md`
- `resources/` → `openclaw-memory/fitness/resources/`

### Why
Single agent, single memory. Workout planning benefits from cross-domain context (work schedule, energy levels, daily logs) that lives in the main workspace. Inspired by the "deep evolution over fragmentation" principle.

### Weekly records going forward
- Daily session logs → `openclaw-memory/memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md`
- Completed weekly summaries can still be pushed here for archival

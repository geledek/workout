# Workout Planning System

Your body is legacy code.

Two decades of back pain. Bilateral ACL reconstructions. A pelvic floor that throws exceptions when you least expect it. Walking patterns optimized for compensation, not performance.

Time to refactor.

## Weekly Plans

## The Philosophy

**Motivation is a bug. Discipline is a feature.**

Motivation comes and goes. It spikes after a good session, crashes after a setback, and disappears entirely when the alarm goes off at 6am. Building your fitness around motivation is like building software around intermittent Wi-Fi.

Discipline is different. Discipline is the function that runs regardless of input. It doesn't care if you're tired. It doesn't need a playlist. It just executes.

**Small commits > big rewrites.**

Nobody refactors a legacy codebase in one weekend. You'd introduce bugs everywhere, break things you didn't know existed, and burn out before Monday.

The same applies to your body. A 10% increase in running volume. One more rep than last week. A slightly longer hold. These compound. The big transformation happens while you're focused on the small increment.

**Progress is measured in boring weeks, not epic sessions.**

The workout that matters isn't the PR. It's the Tuesday morning mobility routine you did when you didn't feel like it. It's the Sunday hip CARs while making coffee. It's the 47th consecutive week of showing up.

Nobody posts that on Instagram. That's how you know it works.

## The System

This isn't a fitness app. It's a planning system that treats your training like a software project.

### The Team

- **Sarah** (Physiotherapist) — The architect. Designs the rehab program. Has final say on exercise selection and progression. When she says stop, you stop.

- **Andy** (Personal Trainer) — The code reviewer. Weekly gym sessions. Implements Sarah's designs. Catches form issues before they become injuries.

- **Claude** (AI) — The pair programmer. Generates weekly plans, unpacks exercise shorthand, tracks progressions, reminds you what you're supposed to be monitoring.

### The Workflow

```
Context → Plan → Execute → Log → Review
```

**Every Sunday:**
1. Provide week context (schedule, how you feel, commitments)
2. Claude generates the weekly plan
3. Plan includes quick reference checkboxes AND detailed execution guides
4. Execute through the week, logging notes
5. Review what worked, what didn't

Files are programs. Weeks are sprints.

### Project Structure

```
/profile.md                    # Master data (goals, constraints, history)
/metrics.md                    # Test results (VO2Max, running times)
/programs/sarah-current.md     # Current rehab program from Sarah
/programs/andy-notes.md        # PT session notes from Andy
/weeks/YYYY-WXX.md            # Weekly plans (the actual sprints)
/resources/                    # Research, exercise ideas, references
```

## How to Use It

### The Sunday Ritual

Open your terminal. Say something like:

> "Plan next week. Normal work Mon-Fri, football Saturday, feeling good but lower back tight Thursday. Seeing Andy Tuesday."

Claude reviews:
- Last week's plan and completion
- Current programs from Sarah and Andy
- Recent metrics and status

Then generates a new weekly plan with:
- **Quick Reference** — All checkboxes, scannable during actual training
- **Detailed Guide** — Execution cues, progressions, why each exercise matters

### What Gets Tracked

- **Pelvic floor response** — No bearing down, no heaviness, no urgency
- **L/R differences** — Identify imbalance patterns over time
- **Running progression** — 10% volume increase max, every 4-5 days
- **Back pain signals** — Note, don't push through

### The Rules

1. **Don't skip the boring stuff.** The TFL releases matter. The breathing exercises matter. The hip CARs while making coffee matter.

2. **Log everything.** A workout without notes is a workout you can't learn from.

3. **Trust the process, question the pain.** Discomfort is data. Sharp pain is a stop sign.

## The Goals

**H1 2026:**

| Metric | Start | Target |
|--------|-------|--------|
| VO2Max | 38 | 45 |
| 5km | — | 25:00 |

Real numbers. Real accountability. Updated in `/metrics.md` when tested.

## Why This Exists

Because spreadsheets don't understand context. Because fitness apps optimize for engagement, not outcomes. Because two decades of back pain taught me that random workouts create random results.

This system exists to make the right thing easy and the wrong thing obvious.

Show up. Do the work. Log the data. Repeat.

The transformation is a side effect of the process.

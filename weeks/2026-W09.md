## Sarah's Program Update (21 Feb)

Sarah issued an updated program this week with significant changes:

### Key Changes from Previous Program:
1. **New plyometrics added:** Depth drops to vertical jump, squat jumps onto plyo box, band-supported lateral hops
2. **Bulgarian split squats:** No longer heel elevated
3. **Hip thrusts on bench** added to Workout B
4. **Captain Morgans with foam roller** added to Workout B
5. **Running pace cap set:** 6'40"/km at 4-5km, don't increase frequency
6. **Plyo instruction:** Balance ground contact time and height — don't sacrifice height for ground contact time

### Compliance This Week:
- ⚠️ No structured Workout A or B completed this week
- ✅ Running completed within pace cap (6'22" avg under 6'40" cap)
- ✅ Distance within 4-5km range
- ❌ Daily hip airplanes — not tracked/confirmed

## Week Summary

| Metric | W08 | W09 | Trend |
|--------|-----|-----|-------|
| Running volume | ~6km (18 Feb) | 4.02km | ↓ |
| Avg run pace | 7'12"/km | 6'22"/km | ↑ Faster |
| Avg run HR | 153 | 158 | ↑ Higher (heat) |
| Cadence | 168 | 166 | → Stable |
| Football | — | 8.24km/2.5h | ✅ |
| Workout A | ✅ | ❌ | ⚠️ |
| Workout B | — | ❌ | ⚠️ |
| Total active distance | ~6km | 12.26km | ↑ (football) |

## Key Observations

1. **Pace improvement is real** — jumped from 7'12" to 6'22", a 50 sec/km improvement. But cardiac cost was high (effort 9 vs effort 6).

2. **Heat tax is significant** — 158 avg HR at 6'22" in heat vs 153 at 7'12" in milder conditions. Expect ~10 BPM heat penalty.

3. **Pacing strategy needs work** — first km was fastest (6:02) every time. Feb 15 (negative splits starting at 7:38) produced the best HR control. Start at 6:40 target, not below.

4. **Gym compliance dropped** — no structured Workout A or B this week. Sarah's new program has plyometrics that need to start. Priority for W10.

5. **Football provides good cardio base** — 8.24km, 2.5h, avg HR 141. Solid aerobic volume without running-specific stress.

## Priorities for W10
- [ ] Start Sarah's updated Workout A and Workout B (1x each)
- [ ] Run at 6:40/km pace cap — start first km at 6:40-6:50, not 6:02
- [ ] Target HR <150 for runs — slow down if HR exceeds 155
- [ ] Resume daily hip airplanes (track compliance)
- [ ] Football Tuesday 7-9pm (already calendared)
- [ ] PT session Wednesday 8pm (already confirmed)

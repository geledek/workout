# DETAILED GUIDE

Reference this section for execution cues, why's, and deep dives on each exercise.

---

## Sunday 19 Jan - Detailed Guide

### Morning Daily Routine

**Purpose:** Wake up the system, establish pelvic floor control. Sequence: release → breathe → activate → integrate.

#### TFL Releases (do FIRST)
- 2-3 mins per side with foam roller or ball
- Position: Side-lying, roller on outer hip/thigh junction
- **Why:** Your TFL overworks (common with back history). Releasing it first allows glutes to activate properly.
- **Feel for:** Tender spots, don't grind - sustained pressure until tissue releases

#### Breathing and Body Awareness
**Supine to crook (3-5 mins):**
- Lie on back, knees bent, feet flat
- Inhale: Ribs expand laterally, belly rises gently
- Exhale: Feel pelvic floor gently lift, ribs drop
- **Cue:** "Breathe into your back pockets"

**Sitting (2-3 mins):**
- Sit bones grounded, feel pelvic floor connection
- Same breath pattern

**Standing (2-3 mins):**
- Weight balanced, slight pelvic floor awareness
- **Why for you:** Post-pelvic floor spike, this retrains coordination. Also addresses walking imbalance.

#### Glute Bridges (x 10-15)
- Feet hip-width, drive through heels
- **Cue:** Push floor away, not hips up. "Long spine" not "high hips"
- **Why:** Hip extension from GLUTES, not lower back.
- **Check:** Feel glutes more than hamstrings? If hamstrings cramp, bring feet closer.
- **Pelvic floor:** Exhale as you lift. If bearing down, you're pushing too hard.

#### Hip Airplanes (x 12-15 per side)
- Stand on one leg, hinge forward ~45°
- Rotate pelvis open (external rotation), then closed (internal rotation)
- Arms out for balance
- **Cue:** "Show your pocket to the wall, then hide it"
- **Why:** Tests single-leg stability. This is BASELINE version; harder versions come later.
- **Quality:** Note left vs right differences.

---

### 2x/Week Program - Detailed Guide

#### Supported Cossacks (x 20 total)
- Wide stance, hold support (rack, TRX, door frame)
- Shift weight to one side, bending that knee, straighten other leg
- Keep heel down on bent leg, toes up on straight leg
- **Cue:** "Sit into your hip, not forward over knee"
- **Why:** Lateral hip mobility + adductor length. Your pelvic tension during football relates to tight adductors.

#### Quadruped Hip CARs (x 2-3 sets x 5 each direction, each side)
- On hands and knees, lift one knee
- Draw the BIGGEST circle you can with that knee (controlled)
- Forward circles, then backward circles
- **Cue:** "Keep back flat like a table - only hip moves"
- **Why:** Full hip ROM in all planes. Prepares hip for loaded work.
- **Quality > Size:** Smaller controlled circle beats big sloppy one.

#### McGill Big 3

Core endurance foundation. HOLDS not reps. Spine-sparing.

**Curl-Up (NOT a crunch):**
- Set 1: 6 reps x 8s holds
- Set 2: 4 reps x 8s holds
- Set 3: 2 reps x 8s holds
- **Setup:** One knee bent, one leg straight. Hands under lower back to maintain curve.
- **Execution:** Brace core, lift head/shoulders ~1 inch. Hold. Lower.
- **Cue:** "Make head heavy in hands" - don't pull with neck
- **Why:** Anterior core WITHOUT spinal flexion. Critical for back history.
- **Check:** Lower back stays in contact with hands.

**Side Plank (BASE version):**
- Set 1: 6 reps x 8s per side
- Set 2: 4 reps x 8s per side
- Set 3: 2 reps x 8s per side
- **Setup:** On elbow and KNEES (bent 90°). Top arm on hip.
- **Execution:** Lift hips, straight line from knees to shoulders. Hold.
- **Cue:** "Stack shoulders, push floor away with elbow"
- **Why:** Lateral core stability. The 3-rounds version is HARDER (top knee extended).

**Bird-Dog:**
- Set 1: 6 reps x 8s per side
- Set 2: 4 reps x 8s per side
- Set 3: 2 reps x 8s per side
- **Setup:** Hands and knees, spine neutral
- **Execution:** Extend opposite arm and leg. Hold.
- **Cue:** "Reach long, not high. Thumb up, heel back."
- **Why:** Anti-rotation + anti-extension.
- **Check:** Hips stay LEVEL. If hip drops, you're rotating.

#### Hip Airplanes (x 15 per side)
- Same as morning, MORE REPS
- **Total hip airplanes today before loaded version:** ~27-30 per side
- **Why:** Building endurance before loading in the circuit
- **Watch:** Fatigue = sloppiness. Rest if control degrades.

#### Elbow Planks (3 x 45-60s)
- Forearms on ground, elbows under shoulders, body straight
- **Cue:** "Pull elbows toward toes (don't slide). Tuck tailbone slightly."
- **Critical:** NO lower back pain or "dumping." If you feel low back, rest and reset.
- **Pelvic floor:** If bearing down, plank is too intense. Shorten time or elevate hands.

---

### 3 Rounds - Detailed Guide

Rest 30-60s between exercises, 2 mins between rounds.

#### Seated Lumbar Lateral Flexion (4kg x 8-10 per side)
- Sit on bench, DB in one hand at side
- Slowly lower DB toward floor (side bend), return
- **Cue:** "Should feel EASY. Control, not work."
- **Why:** Downregulates overactive QL. Your back history = QL works overtime.
- **Mistake:** Don't grip hard, don't make it a workout. Smooth, almost passive.

#### Hamstring Bridge Iso Hold
- Both legs x 30s, then single leg x 15s each
- **Setup:** Heels on bench/box (knees ~90°), hips lifted
- **Cue:** "Drive through heels, squeeze glutes, don't let hips sag"
- **Why:** Posterior chain stability. Important for running and football.
- **Single leg check:** Hips stay LEVEL. Note which side drops.

#### Single Leg RDLs (7kg x 8-10 per side)
- Stand on one leg, DB in opposite hand (or both hands)
- Hinge at hip, free leg extends back, torso forward. Return.
- **Cue:** "Hip goes back, not down. Reach DB toward floor."
- **Why:** Hip hinge + single-leg stability. Prepares for running.
- **Check:** Back stays FLAT. If rounding, reduce range or weight.

#### Hip Airplanes with 8kg KB (x 8-10 per side)
- Same as earlier, BUT: hold KB at chest, don't bend standing knee as much
- **Cue:** "Stiffer knee = more hip work, less knee compensation"
- **Why:** PROGRESSION. You've done ~45 bodyweight hip airplanes. Now loaded.
- **Today's hip airplane progression:**
  1. Morning: x12-15 bodyweight (wake up)
  2. 2x/week: x15 bodyweight (volume)
  3. Here: x8-10 with KB (intensity)

#### Side Plank Extended (x 8 per side, 8s holds)
- Elbow and KNEE on ground, TOP leg extended straight
- Lift hips, hold 8 seconds, lower, repeat
- **Why:** HARDER than McGill side plank (longer lever)
- **Progression:** McGill (both knees bent) built base. This challenges further.
- **If back hurts:** Regress to McGill version.

## Monday 20 Jan - Detailed Guide

### The Run

**3-4km Easy Run:**
- **Distance:** Start with 3km. Extend to 4km ONLY if feeling excellent.
- **Pace:** 6:30-7:00/km (conversational)
- **Sarah's Protocol:** Every 4-5 days, max 10% volume increase/week. This is Day 1 baseline.

**What to Monitor:**
- Pelvic floor: Bearing down? Heaviness? Urgency?
- Walking imbalance: Even on both legs? Hip drop?
- Breathing: Can you maintain nasal breathing?
- Back: Tightness or guarding?

**Stop If:** Pelvic floor tension, back pain, unusual fatigue, sharp pain

### Seated Pelvic Tilts with Band
- Band around thighs, seated upright
- Tilt pelvis forward (slight arch) and back (slight tuck)
- 10-15 slow reps
- **Why:** Eccentric anterior core control (Sarah's note). Band adds feedback.
- **Cue:** Move from pelvis, not shoulders. Small movement, big awareness.

### Upper Body
**Why Today:** Gives pelvic floor recovery from run while maintaining training. No intra-abdominal pressure.

**Push-Ups (3 x 10-15):**
- Option: Incline if regular too challenging
- Exhale on push, no breath holding

**Rows (3 x 10-12):**
- DB or band
- Pull to hip, squeeze shoulder blade, control lower

**Overhead Press (3 x 8-10):**
- Light weight
- Don't brace excessively
- If bearing down, weight too heavy

**Pull-Aparts (2 x 15):**
- Posterior shoulder health, posture support

---

### Evening Run Session - Detailed Guide

**Why a Longer Evening Warm-Up?**

After sitting/working all day:
- Glutes are "asleep"
- Hip flexors are tight
- Pelvic floor coordination isn't as sharp as morning
- Body is stiffer than after morning movement

The morning prep helps, but you need to RE-ACTIVATE everything before running.

**TFL Releases (2 mins per side)**
- Release FIRST before any activation
- Sustained pressure on tender spots
- **Why:** Tight TFL blocks glute activation - critical before running

**Breathing + Pelvic Floor Awareness (3 mins)**
- Standing position (running-specific)
- Inhale: ribs expand, belly softens
- Exhale: gentle pelvic floor lift
- **Why:** Establish coordination BEFORE running demands it

**Glute Bridges x 15**
- Really SQUEEZE at top
- **Cue:** "Wake up your backside before asking it to propel you forward"

**Hip Airplanes x 10 per side**
- Slow and controlled
- **Why:** Single-leg stability check before running

**Cossacks x 10 total**
- Supported, wake up hips laterally
- **Why:** Lateral hip mobility after sitting

**Leg Swings**
- Forward/back x 10 per leg
- Side-to-side x 10 per leg
- **Why:** Dynamic stretching, prep hip flexors and adductors

**Walking Lunges x 10 total**
- **Why:** Activate glutes in GAIT PATTERN (running-specific)

**Running Drills (3-5 mins)**

These rehearse running motion and activate glutes in running-specific patterns. They give feedback on pelvic floor response BEFORE the actual run.

| Drill | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| A-skips x 20m x 2 | Knee drive, hip flexor activation |
| High knees (slow) x 20m x 2 | Running posture, core engagement |
| Butt kicks x 20m x 2 | Hamstring activation, heel recovery |
| Straight leg bounds x 20m x 2 | Glute power, hip extension |

**The Run Notes:**
- **First 5 mins:** Settle in, check pelvic floor, find rhythm
- **Pace:** Easy (6:30-7:00/km) - can hold a conversation
- **If anything feels off in first km:** Stop and assess, don't push through

**Post-Run Protocol:**
- Walk 2-3 mins first - don't stop abruptly
- Hip flexor stretch: Releases after running compression
- Calf stretch: Prevents tightness
- Breathing exercises: Reset pelvic floor coordination

**Key Insight:** The evening warm-up is almost as long as the run itself - that's intentional. Your body needs it after a day of sitting, especially with your pelvic floor and back history.

## Tuesday 21 Jan - Detailed Guide

### Boxing Trial

**What to Monitor:**
- Rotation demands - back protected?
- Impact (punching bags) - pelvic floor pressure?
- Stance work - knees feel OK? (ACL history)
- Core bracing - bearing down or breathing through?
- Energy - sustainable or exhausting?

**Questions for Instructor:**
- Typical class structure?
- How often do students train per week?
- Can sessions be modified for rehab-to-performance transition?

**Post-Boxing Stretches:**
- Hip flexor stretch
- Thoracic rotation stretch (after punching rotation)
- Shoulder/lat stretch
- Deep breathing to downregulate

---

## Wednesday 22 Jan - Detailed Guide

### Hotel Light Mobility

**Purpose:** Movement quality only. No loading. Restorative, not training.

**Hip CARs:**
- Quadruped position
- Biggest controlled circle with knee
- Forward, then backward
- **Go slow:** 5-count per circle

**Breathing Progressions:**
- Supine: Let travel tension melt away
- Sitting: Feel sit bones grounded
- Standing: Note imbalances from sitting on plane

---

## Thursday 23 Jan - Detailed Guide

### Modified 2x/Week

**Why 2 rounds:** Mid-travel, possibly tired, massage coming. Quality over quantity.

**Equipment Adaptation:**
- Seated lateral flexion: 3-5kg is fine
- Hamstring bridge: Use bed/bench/chair
- Single leg RDLs: 5-8kg per hand, or bodyweight with arms reaching
- Hip airplanes: Hotel DB 6-10kg, or bodyweight with stiffer knee

### Massage Session

**Request:** "Focus on lower back, glute region, TFL, hip flexors, any external pelvic floor tension"

**Communicate:**
- Recent pelvic floor tension spike, now recovered
- Walking imbalance - any L/R tightness differences?
- Football = pelvic tension during games
- Rehab-to-performance transition for back

**Ask:**
- Significant L/R differences?
- Where are tightest areas?
- Recommendations?

## Friday 24 Jan - Detailed Guide

### Andy Session - Upper Body

**Why Upper Body:** Give pelvic floor/lower body break before Saturday's big session.

**Brief Andy:**
- Pelvic floor spike (recovered)
- Monday run results
- Boxing Tuesday results
- Modified hotel session Thursday
- Saturday = full single-leg program
- Request upper body focus + movement quality assessment

**Core Work (Light):**
- Pallof Press: 2 x 10 per side (anti-rotation)
- Dead Bug: 2 x 8 per side
- **Avoid:** Heavy planks, bearing down

---

## Saturday 25 Jan - Detailed Guide

### Single Leg Squats (3 x 15 per side)
- Stand on one leg, arms forward
- Squat down as low as controlled, return
- **Cues:**
  - "Knee tracks over toes - don't cave in"
  - "Hip stays level - no hiking"
  - "Equal depth L and R"
- **Why 15 reps:** Endurance + motor pattern drilling

### Single Leg Hop NCM (Non-Counter Movement)
**With Orange Band (3 x 10):**
- Band around thighs, stand on one leg
- Small hop in place, land soft, stabilize, repeat
- **Cues:**
  - "Land soft - absorb with hip, not just knee"
  - "Stabilize completely before next hop"
  - "Band shouldn't collapse - keep knees apart"
- **Pelvic floor:** Exhale on landing. If bearing down, slow down.

**Front/Back (3 x 8):**
- Same, but hop forward slightly, then backward
- **Cues:**
  - "Small controlled hops"
  - "Land in same foot position each time"
  - "Watch for knee cave on forward hop"

### Supported Single Leg Hop onto Stepper (5 x 6)
- Hold support, stand on one leg, stepper in front
- Hop up, land on same leg, stabilize, step down
- **THIS IS PRECISION WORK:**
  - KEY FOCUS: Equal hips landing - no twisting, no hip hiking
  - Record yourself if possible
  - Both sides should look identical
- **Cues:**
  - "Land quietly"
  - "Hips perfectly level at landing"
  - "No rotation - belly button points forward"
- **Why:** Directly addresses walking imbalance and football pelvic tension. If one hip hikes/twists = compensation pattern.

### Banded Lunges Pushing Up (2 x 12)
- Band around thighs, lunge position
- Lower, then EXPLOSIVE push through front heel
- **Cues:**
  - "Drive through heel, not toes"
  - "Band keeps you honest - no knee cave"

### Bulgarian Squats - Heel Elevated (3 x 6-8)
- Back foot on bench, front foot on plate/slant (heel elevated)
- Lower until back knee nearly touches, drive up
- **Why heel elevated:** More quad emphasis, deeper range, reduces forward lean (protects back)
- **Cues:**
  - "Control eccentric - 3 seconds down"
  - "Drive through front heel"
  - "Torso stays upright"
- **Weight:** DBs at sides if adding load. Start bodyweight if new to heel elevation.

---

## Running Progression Reference

**Sarah's Guidelines (Next 3 Weeks):**
- Frequency: Every 4-5 days
- Volume: Max 10% increase per week

**Week 4:** Monday Jan 20 - 3-4km test run
**Week 5:** Next run 4-5 days later, max +10% volume
**Week 6:** Continue progression
**Week 7:** Re-assess with Sarah

---

## Hip Airplane Progressions

**Daily (Morning):** x 12-15 bodyweight - wake up/activate
**2x/Week Program:** x 15 bodyweight - volume accumulation
**3-Round Circuit:** x 8-10 with 8kg KB, stiffer knee - intensity/load

**Why 3 versions?** Progressive overload within a single day. Each version builds on previous. By the time you do loaded version, you've drilled the pattern 30+ times.

---

## Side Plank Progressions

**McGill Side Plank (Base):** Elbow + both knees bent
- Building lateral core endurance, spine-safe position

**Extended Side Plank (Progression):** Elbow + bottom knee, top leg extended
- Longer lever = more demand
- Only progress when base version is solid

---

## Pelvic Floor Checkpoints

**Key moments to monitor:**
- Breathing exercises: Can you feel gentle lift on exhale?
- Glute bridges: Any bearing down?
- Planks: Any pressure/heaviness?
- Running: Any urgency, heaviness, bearing down?
- Hopping: Exhale on landing, no bearing down

**If bearing down occurs:** Scale back intensity. Rest. Note for Sarah.

---

## Left/Right Tracking

**Exercises to compare sides:**
- Hip airplanes: Equal control?
- Single leg RDLs: Equal depth/stability?
- Hamstring bridge (single leg): Hip drop?
- Single leg squats: Equal depth?
- Stepper hops: Hip hiking or twisting?

**Pattern to watch:** If same side consistently weaker = compensation pattern = report to Sarah

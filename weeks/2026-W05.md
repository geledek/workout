# DETAILED GUIDE

Reference this section for execution cues, why's, and deep dives on each exercise.

---

## Monday 26 Jan - Detailed Guide

### Running Session

**Why Run Today:**
- 6 days since last run (Tue Jan 20) - at edge of Sarah's 4-5 day window
- Running frequency is critical for adaptation
- Tomorrow is travel day - no opportunity to run

**Pre-Run Decision:**
If legs have significant DOMS from Sunday's single-leg session:
- Do light mobility instead (hip CARs, breathing, gentle stretches)
- Run Wednesday in Germany instead
- This is OK - listen to your body

**Target: 5.5km**
- 10% increase from 5.03km last week
- Same easy pace (6:30-7:00/km)
- Focus on form and pelvic floor awareness, not speed

**What to Monitor:**
- Pelvic floor: Any bearing down, heaviness, urgency?
- Hip symmetry: Even stride on both legs?
- Back: Any tightness or guarding?
- Breathing: Can maintain nasal/conversational?

**Last Week's Run Data (for comparison):**
- Distance: 5.03km
- Time: 35:33
- Avg Pace: 7'04"/km
- Avg HR: 152 BPM
- Splits: 7'28" → 7'19" → 6'58" → 6'43" → 6'42" (negative splits)

**This Week's Target:**
- Distance: 5.5km
- Time: ~38-40 mins
- Pace: 6:30-7:15/km
- Try for similar negative split pattern

## Tuesday 27 Jan - Detailed Guide

### Travel Day Protocol

**Morning Before Flight:**
- Keep it light - you have a long day ahead
- Hip airplanes activate glutes before sitting
- Breathing resets nervous system before travel stress

**During Flight (Long Haul):**
- DVT prevention: Ankle circles, calf raises while seated
- Every 1-2 hours: Walk the aisle
- Seated hip flexor stretch: Slide forward in seat, extend one leg back slightly
- Stay hydrated

**After Arrival:**
- Jet lag affects recovery and performance
- Light walk helps reset circadian rhythm
- Don't try to train - just move gently
- Early sleep if possible

**Why Rest Today:**
- Long haul flight is physically stressful
- Dehydration and sitting compress discs
- Jet lag impairs coordination (injury risk)
- Wednesday session will be better with proper rest

---

## Wednesday 28 Jan - Detailed Guide

### 2x/Week Program - Hotel Adaptation

**Equipment Checklist:**
- Dumbbells: What weights available? 4-10kg ideal
- Bench or stable surface for hamstring bridges
- Floor space for planks and hip work
- Foam roller? (Or use water bottle/tennis ball for TFL)

**If Limited Equipment:**
- Lateral flexion: Use whatever DB available, or water bottle
- Hamstring bridges: Bed or chair works
- Single leg RDLs: Bodyweight with arms reaching forward
- Hip airplanes: Bodyweight with stiffer knee (more challenging)

**Jet Lag Consideration:**
- First real session after travel
- May feel sluggish - that's normal
- Focus on quality over intensity
- 2 rounds instead of 3 is acceptable

**McGill Big 3 Reminders:**

*Curl-Up:*
- NOT a crunch - lift head/shoulders 1 inch only
- Hands under lower back to maintain curve
- Hold 8 seconds, breathe normally

*Side Plank:*
- On elbow and KNEES (both bent)
- This is the BASE version
- Straight line from knees to shoulders

*Bird-Dog:*
- Opposite arm and leg extend
- Hips stay LEVEL - no rotation
- "Reach long, not high"

## Thursday 29 Jan - Detailed Guide

### Upper Body - Shoulder Modification

**Left Shoulder Protocol:**
- Pain was 4/10 on overhead press with Andy
- Today: Test with VERY light weight or skip entirely
- Pressing: Bench press usually OK (different angle)
- Pulling: Generally safe and beneficial

**Exercise Priorities:**

*Do These (Safe for Shoulder):*
1. DB Rows - full ROM, squeeze shoulder blade
2. Lat pulldowns - controlled, no jerking
3. Face pulls - external rotation strengthens rotator cuff
4. Bench press - if pain-free, keep weight moderate

*Modify These:*
1. Push-ups - incline reduces shoulder load
2. Overhead press - skip or use 2-3kg only

*Skip If Pain:*
- Any exercise that reproduces the 4/10 pain
- Behind-neck movements
- Wide grip pressing

**Core Work Notes:**
- Pallof press: Anti-rotation, minimal spinal load
- Dead bugs: Exhale as you extend, no back arch
- Keep intensity LOW - support work, not main training

## Friday 30 Jan - Detailed Guide

### 2x/Week Program #2

**Why Same Program Twice:**
- Sarah prescribes 2x/week for a reason
- Repetition builds motor patterns
- Second session often feels smoother
- Note improvements from Wednesday

**Comparison Points:**
After the session, note:
- Did hip airplanes feel more controlled?
- Was one side catching up to the other?
- Did McGill exercises feel easier?
- Energy level compared to Wednesday?

**3 Rounds Today:**
- Wednesday may have been 2 rounds (jet lag)
- Today aim for full 3 rounds
- If still fatigued, 2 rounds is fine

---

## Saturday 31 Jan - Detailed Guide

### Treadmill Running

**Why Treadmill:**
- Cold weather in Germany (outdoor not ideal)
- Controlled environment
- Consistent pace feedback
- 1% incline simulates outdoor running resistance

**Treadmill Settings:**
- Speed: 8.5-9.2 km/h (gives 6:30-7:00/km pace)
- Incline: 1%
- If too easy, increase speed slightly, NOT incline

**Treadmill vs Outdoor:**
- Treadmill pulls your leg back (less hamstring work)
- Compensate with slightly higher cadence
- Focus on lifting knees, not pushing back
- May feel different on pelvic floor - monitor

**Running Frequency Check:**
- Monday: Run #1 (5.5km)
- Saturday: Run #2 (5.5km)
- Gap: 5 days - within Sarah's 4-5 day window
- Total weekly volume: 11km

**Next Week Preview:**
- Next run: ~Wed Feb 4 or Thu Feb 5
- Distance: Stay at 5.5km or slight increase to 5.7km
- Max 10% weekly volume increase

## Sunday 1 Feb - Detailed Guide

### Single Leg Work - Focus Points

**Last Week's Observations:**
- Right side: Less strength in single leg squats
- Stepper hops: Hip hiking/twisting "hard to describe"
- Pelvic floor: No problems during hopping

**This Week's Focus:**

*Single Leg Squats:*
- Pay extra attention to RIGHT side quality
- Equal depth on both sides
- If right struggles, note at what rep
- Consider: Is right hip tighter? Weaker glute?

*Stepper Hops:*
- Try to identify the "hard to describe" issue
- Film yourself if possible
- Watch for: Hip drop, rotation, knee cave
- Use mirror if available

**Hotel Equipment Adaptation:**

*If No Orange Band:*
- NCM hops: Do without band (still valuable)
- Banded lunges: Regular lunges with focus on form
- Alternative: Hold light DBs at sides

*If No Stepper:*
- Use stable gym bench or platform
- Stair if available
- Height: 6-10 inches ideal

**Pelvic Floor Checkpoints:**
- NCM hops: Exhale on landing
- Stepper hops: Exhale on landing
- If any bearing down: Reduce intensity, rest
- Note: You had no issues last week - maintain

**L/R Tracking Template:**
| Exercise | Left | Right | Notes |
|----------|------|-------|-------|
| SL Squats depth | /10 | /10 | |
| SL Squats stability | /10 | /10 | |
| Stepper hip control | /10 | /10 | |
| Bulgarian depth | /10 | /10 | |

- Frequency: Every 4-5 days
- Volume: Max 10% increase per week

**Week 4:** Tue Jan 20 - 5.03km
**Week 5:** Mon Jan 26 + Sat Jan 31 - 5.5km each (11km total)
**Week 6:** Continue ~5.5-6km per run
**Week 7:** Re-assess with Sarah

---

## Hip Airplane Progressions (This Week)

**Daily (Morning):** x 12-15 bodyweight - wake up/activate
**2x/Week Program:** x 15 bodyweight - volume accumulation
**3-Round Circuit:** x 8-10 with hotel DB or BW stiffer knee - intensity

---

## Pelvic Floor Checkpoints

**Key moments to monitor:**
- Breathing exercises: Gentle lift on exhale?
- Glute bridges: No bearing down?
- Planks: No pressure/heaviness?
- Running: No urgency, heaviness?
- Hopping: Exhale on landing, no bearing down

**If issues occur:** Scale back, rest, note for Sarah.

---

## Left Shoulder Monitoring

**This Week:**
- Thursday upper body: Test carefully
- Note pain level (0-10) on each exercise
- Compare to Andy session (was 4/10 on overhead press)

**If Pain Persists:**
- Avoid overhead pressing entirely
- Focus on rows and pulls
- Mention to Sarah if still 4/10+ next week

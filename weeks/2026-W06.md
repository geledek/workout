# Week 6: Feb 2 - Feb 8, 2026

## Weekly Status
- **Back Pain:** TBD (carry forward from W05)
- **Energy:** TBD (workshop fatigue expected)
- **Weight:** ~77kg
- **Pelvic Floor:** Stable (no issues W05)
- **Left Shoulder:** Monitor (was 4/10 W05)
- **Notable:** Full-day workshops Mon-Thu, flying back to Singapore Friday afternoon

## This Week's Context
- **Location:** Germany Mon-Thu, travel Friday, Singapore Sat-Sun
- **Workshops:** Full day Mon-Thu - zero gym time
- **Travel:** Friday afternoon flight back to Singapore (long haul)
- **Gym Access:** Friday early morning (hotel gym), Saturday-Sunday (home gym)
- **Running Status:** Last runs W05 Mon + Sat (5.5km each). Gap will be ~7 days by Friday - overdue but unavoidable
- **Strategy:** Daily routines only Mon-Thu (hotel room, 15 mins morning). Friday morning = key session. Weekend = catch up on program

**Reality Check:** This is a low-volume maintenance week. Workshops drain energy. Don't stress about missing sessions - focus on daily minimums and a quality Friday morning before the flight.

# DETAILED GUIDE

---

## Mon-Thu Workshop Days - Detailed Guide

### Why Daily Routine Still Matters

Four days of sitting in workshops will tighten hip flexors, compress lower back, and deactivate glutes. The 15-minute morning routine is your minimum effective dose:

- **TFL releases:** Prevent hip flexor tightening from prolonged sitting
- **Breathing exercises:** Maintain pelvic floor awareness and core connection
- **Glute bridges:** Counter the effects of sitting (hip extension, glute activation)
- **Hip airplanes:** Keep hip stability and proprioception active

### Hotel Room Setup
- TFL release: Use a tennis ball, lacrosse ball, or even a water bottle against a wall
- Glute bridges: Floor or bed (floor preferred for stability)
- Hip airplanes: Need ~2m clear space
- Breathing: Supine on floor or bed

### Evening Walks
Optional but highly recommended:
- 15-20 mins of walking after a full day sitting counters disc compression
- Helps with sleep, especially with lingering jet lag
- Cossacks on Wednesday evening keep hip adductors mobile
- Don't push if genuinely exhausted from workshops

### Sitting Posture Reminders
- Change position every 30-45 mins during workshops
- Occasional seated pelvic tilts (subtle - nobody will notice)
- Brief standing stretches during breaks

## Friday 6 Feb - Detailed Guide

### Light Day Before Travel

2x/week #1 is done (Tuesday evening). Friday morning is just daily routine before checkout.

### Travel Protocol
Same as W05 Tuesday - ankle circles, walk the aisle, stay hydrated. Long haul back to Singapore will be tiring. Saturday run should account for jet lag.

---

## Saturday 7 Feb - Detailed Guide

### Running After a Gap

**The Situation:**
- Last run: ~W05 Sat Jan 31 (5.5km)
- Today: Feb 7 = ~7 day gap
- This exceeds Sarah's 4-5 day window
- Plus jet lag from long haul flight

**The Approach:**
- DO NOT increase distance - stay at 5.5km
- Be generous with pace - 7:00+/km is fine
- Focus on form and pelvic floor awareness
- If legs feel heavy or jet-lagged, scale to 4-5km

**What to Watch For After a Gap:**
- First km will feel rough - don't judge the run by it
- Breathing may feel harder than usual
- Pelvic floor: Extra awareness needed after detraining gap
- Hip symmetry: May feel tighter on one side after travel

**Running Progression Update:**
- W04: 5.03km
- W05: 5.5km x 2 (11km total)
- W06: 5.5km x 1 (maintenance week - low volume is fine)
- W07: Resume 2x running, consider 5.7-6km

**Comparison to W05 Data (for reference):**
- W05 target was 5.5km at 6:30-7:00/km
- Today expect slightly slower given the gap
- Negative splits still the goal if feeling good

## Sunday 8 Feb - Detailed Guide

### Double Session Strategy

**Why Both Programs Today:**
- Only got 1x 2x/week session this week (Friday = #1)
- Need #2 plus the 1x/week single leg work
- Home gym = full equipment, no time pressure
- Split into two sessions or one longer session with a break

**Option A: One Long Session (~90 mins)**
- 2x/week program first (40 mins)
- 10 min rest/water
- Single leg work (40 mins)

**Option B: Two Separate Sessions**
- Morning: 2x/week program
- Afternoon/evening: Single leg work
- Better recovery between, but requires two gym trips

**2x/Week #2 Notes:**
- Full 3 rounds today (Friday was only 2)
- Compare quality to Friday's session
- Home gym: Use proper weights (4kg DB lateral flexion, 7kg DB RDLs, 8kg KB hip airplanes)

**Single Leg Work Focus:**
- Same as W05 Sunday
- Track R vs L on single leg squats (right was weaker)
- Film stepper hops if possible (to identify the "hard to describe" issue)
- Orange band + stepper available at home

**Pelvic Floor Checkpoints (Extra Important Today):**
- Long session = fatigue = higher risk of bearing down
- NCM hops: Exhale on landing
- Stepper hops: Exhale on landing
- If heaviness or bearing down: Stop, rest, breathe, resume or quit
- Last week had no issues - maintain awareness

**L/R Tracking Template:**
| Exercise | Left | Right | Notes |
|----------|------|-------|-------|
| SL Squats depth | /10 | /10 | |
| SL Squats stability | /10 | /10 | |
| NCM hop control | /10 | /10 | |
| Stepper hip control | /10 | /10 | |
| Bulgarian depth | /10 | /10 | |

## Running Progression Reference

**Sarah's Guidelines:**
- Frequency: Every 4-5 days
- Volume: Max 10% increase per week

**W04:** Tue Jan 20 - 5.03km
**W05:** Mon Jan 26 + Sat Jan 31 - 5.5km each (11km total)
**W06:** Sat Feb 7 - 5.5km (maintenance, ~5.5km total)
**W07:** Resume 2x running, target 5.5-6km per run

---

## Hip Airplane Progressions (This Week)

**Daily (Morning):** x 12-15 bodyweight - wake up/activate (Mon-Thu hotel room)
**2x/Week Program (Fri + Sun):** x 15 bodyweight - volume accumulation
**3-Round Circuit (Fri 2-round, Sun 3-round):** x 8-10 loaded or BW stiffer knee - intensity

---

## Pelvic Floor Checkpoints

**Key moments to monitor:**
- Breathing exercises: Gentle lift on exhale?
- Glute bridges: No bearing down?
- Planks: No pressure/heaviness?
- Running (Saturday): No urgency, heaviness? (Extra awareness after gap)
- Hopping (Sunday): Exhale on landing, no bearing down

**If issues occur:** Scale back, rest, note for Sarah.

## Week Summary

| Day | Session | Volume |
|-----|---------|--------|
| Mon | Daily routine only (15 min) | Minimum |
| Tue | Daily routine + 2x/week #1 evening (hotel gym) | Moderate |
| Wed | Daily routine only (15 min) | Minimum |
| Thu | Daily routine only (15 min) | Minimum |
| Fri | Daily routine + travel to Singapore | Minimum |
| Sat | Running 5.5km (Singapore) | Moderate |
| Sun | 2x/week #2 - 3 rounds + 1x/week single leg (home gym) | High |

**Weekly Reality:** Low-volume maintenance week. Protect the daily minimums Mon-Thu, get a quality Friday session in, then catch up over the weekend. This is fine - consistency across months matters more than any single week.

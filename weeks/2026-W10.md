# DETAILED GUIDE

## Exercise Execution Cues

### McGill Big 3

**Why:** Foundation core stability without loading the spine. Protects your back during everything else.

**Curl-Up:**
- Setup: Lie on back, one knee bent, one straight. Hands under lower back to maintain neutral arch.
- Execution: Lift head and shoulders ~2cm off ground. Hold 8 seconds. Don't flatten your back — maintain the arch.
- Cue: "Brace like someone's about to poke your stomach."

**Side Plank:**
- Setup: On elbow, knees stacked (this is the BASE version — the extended version comes later in the workout).
- Execution: Lift hips, hold 8 seconds. Don't roll forward or back.
- Cue: "Stack shoulders over elbow, squeeze top glute."

**Bird-Dog:**
- Setup: Hands and knees, neutral spine.
- Execution: Extend opposite arm and leg. Hold 8 seconds. Don't let hips rotate.
- Cue: "Imagine a glass of water on your lower back — don't spill it."

### Hip Airplanes (Loaded, 12kg KB)

**Why:** DHR (dynamic hip rotation) with load builds rotational control. The stiffer knee (less bend) increases hip demand.

- Setup: Stand on one leg holding 12kg KB. Working leg slightly bent but STIFFER than bodyweight version.
- Execution: Hinge forward, rotate torso open, return. Controlled throughout.
- Cue: "Slow and steady. Feel the hip doing the work, not momentum."

### Quadruped Hip CARs

**Why:** CARs = Controlled Articular Rotations. Maps your full hip range of motion and maintains it.

- Setup: Hands and knees.
- Execution: Lift knee to side (hydrant position), rotate forward into extension, reverse back. 5 each direction.
- Cue: "Make the biggest circle you can with your knee while keeping your back still."

### Bulgarian Split Squat (No Heel Elevation)

**Why:** Sarah removed the heel elevation — you've progressed past needing it. This demands more ankle mobility and posterior chain engagement.

- Setup: Rear foot on bench, front foot flat on ground (no heel raise).
- Execution: Lower straight down until rear knee approaches floor. Drive up through front heel.
- Cue: "Vertical shin on the way down. Don't let knee drift inward."

### Extended Side Plank

**Why:** Progression from the base side plank in McGill Big 3. Top knee extended adds rotational demand.

- Setup: Bottom elbow and knee on ground. Top leg extended straight.
- Execution: Lift hips, hold position. 8-10 reps = short hold + lower + repeat.
- Cue: "Long line from top foot through your head."

### Depth Drop to Vertical Jump ⚡ NEW

**Why:** Teaches your body to absorb force (landing) and redirect it (jump). Critical for ACL-reconstructed knees. Two variations build different landing patterns.

- Setup: Stand on a low box/step (start at 15-20cm).
- Execution: Step off (don't jump off), land on both feet, absorb, immediately jump vertically as high as possible.
- Cue: "Land like a cat, then explode. Don't sacrifice height for quick ground contact."
- ⚠️ **Pelvic floor check:** Exhale on landing. No bearing down.

### Captain Morgans with Foam Roller

**Why:** Single-leg balance + hip rotation control. The foam roller adds instability.

- Setup: Stand on one leg, other foot resting on foam roller beside you.
- Execution: Roll the foam roller forward and back with your foot while maintaining balance and hip control.
- Cue: "Hips stay level. Don't lean away from the roller."

### Squat Jump onto Plyo Box ⚡ NEW

**Why:** Concentric power + controlled landing. Box removes the landing impact of a full jump (you land at the top, not back on the ground).

- Setup: Stand facing plyo box, feet shoulder width.
- Execution: Quarter squat, swing arms, jump onto box. Land softly with both feet.
- Cue: "LIGHT landing. If you can hear your feet, you're landing too hard."
- Start with a lower box if unsure. Form > height.

### Band Supported Hops ⚡ NEW

**Why:** Reactive plyometrics with reduced bodyweight impact. The band takes some load off while training the stretch-shortening cycle.

- **Double leg (Workout A):** Continuous hopping in place, 20s on.
- **Single leg vertical (Workout B):** One leg at a time, 15s on.
- **Lateral (Workout B):** Side-to-side hops, 20s on.
- Cue: "Quick feet, stay tall, breathe out on each hop."

## Running Strategy: The 6:40 Rule

Your last 6 runs show a clear pattern: **you start too fast, HR climbs, effort spikes.**

| Run | K1 Pace | Avg HR | Effort |
|-----|---------|--------|--------|
| 7 Feb | 7:12 | 135 | 4 |
| 15 Feb | 7:38 | 145 | 5 ← BEST |
| 1 Mar | 6:02 | 158 | 9 ← WORST |

Feb 15 was your best run because you started slow (7:38) and the body settled in. Mar 1 you went out at 6:02 and paid for it the whole way.

**This week's rule:** First km at 6:40-6:50. If it feels too easy, GOOD. That's the point. Let the speed come to you in km 3-4.
